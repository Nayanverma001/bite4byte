# FoodCycle - Surplus Food Marketplace

Good food should never become waste. This app connects donors with buyers/NGOs.

Data is saved in:
** Browser **: role, user, draft, saved items (per device)
** Server **: foods, interests, notifications, reviews, messages + stored in *data. json ** in the project folder

Restarting the server keeps your data. Refreshing the page loads data from the server.

## Run without server

Open ** index.html ** directly in your browser. Data is stored only in the browser (localStorage). Some features may behave differently when not using the server.

- This project runs completely on the browser.
- Some features may be limited because no backend/server is used.
